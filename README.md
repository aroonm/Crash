Crash

2D Car racing game using C

Crash is a game I deveoped overnight for my Datastructures and Algorithms course in college.

The objective of the assignment was to develop an application using data structures. No surprises there, I guess. 
Anyway, I developed this game using arrays. The cars in the game are arrays, the racetrack with the spectators 
is a lso one large two-dimensional array.
When you run the game you'll notice that the entire application or game has been drawn out using ASCII characters.
That is, no graphics.h and all that!

Once again, I'm uploading this game not because this is the best game I can make. No. I'm uploading this, to
demonstrate how to create the basic skeleton of a game, that with a bit of polishing and a little love, can
become promising.

Playing the Game
Control your race-car with the A and D key, to move left and right respectively. Crash into traffic, and it's game
over. Drive 10,000 miles without crashing to receive your trophy. There is a trophy (I promise). So, happy driving! Enjoy!
